# Project Progress Tracker

This Markdown file tracks the progress of building a Python face tracking tool for live movements in Blender. Each task is listed as a ticket with a checkbox to mark completion. Use this to stay organized and ensure all steps are completed systematically.

## Tickets

### 1. Research and Select a Python Library for Real-Time Face Tracking

- [ ] Evaluate Python libraries such as OpenCV, Dlib, and MediaPipe for real-time face tracking.
- [ ] Focus on accuracy, performance, and the ability to extract detailed facial feature data (e.g., key points for eyes, mouth, and eyebrows).
- **Purpose**: Select a reliable library as the foundation for the face tracking system.

### 2. Implement Basic Face Tracking with Visualization

- [ ] Set up webcam capture using the chosen library.
- [ ] Detect facial key points in real-time.
- [ ] Add visualization (e.g., overlay key points on the video feed) to confirm tracking accuracy.
- **Purpose**: Establish core functionality for capturing and processing facial data.

### 3. Identify and Extract Relevant Facial Feature Data

- [ ] Determine which facial features (e.g., eye positions, mouth shape, eyebrow movement) are necessary to animate Blender models.
- [ ] Extract these specific data points from the tracking output.
- **Purpose**: Ensure the right data is captured for driving animations in Blender.

### 4. Research and Implement Real-Time Data Transmission from Python to Blender

- [ ] Investigate methods for sending data from Python to Blender in real-time (e.g., OSC protocol, sockets).
- [ ] Implement the most suitable approach for real-time data transfer.
- **Purpose**: Enable live communication between the Python tool and Blender.

### 5. Set Up Data Reception and Mapping in Blender

- [ ] Use Blender’s Python API to receive the transmitted facial data.
- [ ] Map the received data to the model’s rigs or shape keys (e.g., linking mouth width to a shape key).
- **Purpose**: Bridge the gap between the Python tool and Blender for live animation.

### 6. Test and Debug the Entire Pipeline

- [ ] Test the full system from video capture to Blender animation.
- [ ] Debug issues related to latency, accuracy, or stability.
- **Purpose**: Ensure the system works reliably in real-time.

### 7. Optimize for Performance

- [ ] Profile the application to identify bottlenecks (e.g., slow tracking or data transmission).
- [ ] Implement optimizations to reduce latency and increase frame rates.
- **Purpose**: Achieve smooth, live animations without noticeable delays.

### 8. (Optional) Develop a Simple GUI

- [ ] Create a basic graphical user interface (e.g., with buttons to start/stop tracking or calibrate the system).
- **Purpose**: Improve usability, especially for future expansions or sharing the tool.

## Additional Notes or Tasks

- [ ] Set up a Git repository for version control.
- [ ] Document progress and decisions in a README or code comments.
- [ ] (Optional) Add a calibration step for different lighting conditions or users.
- [ ] (Optional) Implement recording of tracking data for later use.

**Tips**:

- Complete tickets in order for a smooth workflow.
- Use the checkboxes to track your progress (e.g., change `[ ]` to `[x]` when done).
- Add any new tasks or notes in the "Additional Notes or Tasks" section as needed.
